                                My name is Kelly Shiptoski. I am a detail-oriented and self-driven software
                                engineer
                                with a comprehensive background in designing, building, and maintaining large systems.
                                I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer at Bolt Labs, where I work on both the backend and
                                low-level trusted execution environment to provide the API for a cryptographically secure digital
                                asset management system.
                                My doctoral research provided me with years of experience
                                with low-level Linux development and multiple programming languages,
                                including, but not limited to, Rust, C, and C++.
                                In 2023, I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of
                                Pennsylvania where I was advised by <a target="_blank"

                            <p> Broadly, my interests include operating systems, distributed systems, systems
                                programming, software
                                testing, and software profiling. I adore the <a target="_blank"
                                    href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"><b>
                                        Rust programming language</b></a> and use it regularly in my research. I have
                                extensive experience with the <a target="_blank" href="https://man7.org/tlpi/"><b>Linux
                                        programming interface and system call
                                        API</b></a>, and can dig through system call man pages fearlessly.</p>
                            <p>
                                My doctoral research uses <b>low-level systems techniques</b> such as system call
                                interception
                                and manipulation to provide <b>reproducibility</b> and <b>performance optimizations</b>
                                for unmodified
                                Linux programs. My goal is to build easy-to-use systems that improve existing programs
                                by providing safety
                                guarantees or performance improvements without any extra effort on the part of the user
                                (that's right, no more
                                dependency hell!).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Plenty of technologies exist to improve programs, but they
                                tend to be highly specialized
                                and/or difficult to use. My systems do not require root access, or changes to the
                                application, OS, or hardware. The
                                largest projects to emerge from my doctoral work are <b>ProcessCache</b>, a system for
                                providing automatic caching of arbitrary
                                Linux processes, and <b>DetTrace</b>, a Linux container system that automatically
                                enforces
                                determinism for programs run
                                through it. Both systems are open-source. More information on these projects can be
