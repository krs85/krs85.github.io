                                The <b>ProcessCache</b> system provides a generic facility for automatically memoizing
                                the work
                                of a broad class of multi-process Linux programs. ProcessCache caches results and
                                transparently determines when cached results can be used and when re-execution is
                                necessary. ProcessCache generalizes previous work on forward build systems, to go beyond
                                software builds to other multi-process programs like shell scripts and bioinformatics
                                workflows. ProcessCache supports unmodified Linux binaries, using the ptrace mechanism
                                to trace system calls and determine program inputs. The system utilizes a custom
                                asynchronous runtime (developed in Rust) to obviate latent ptrace overhead. Our
                                experiments show that ProcessCache can automatically provide incremental computation to
                                existing programs, accelerating workloads from 1.06x to 65x. I functioned as technical
                                lead for this project, managing the project and maintaining ownership of it.
                                The open-source code for the project can be found <a target="_blank"

                                <b>DetTrace</b> is a reproducible container abstraction for Linux implemented entirely
                                in
                                userspace. All computation that occurs inside a DetTrace container is a pure function of
                                the initial file system state of the container. Reproducible containers can be used for
                                a variety of purposes, including replication for fault-tolerance, reproducible software
                                builds, and reproducible data analytics. We use DetTrace to achieve, in an automatic
                                fashion, reproducibility for 12,130 Debian package builds, containing over 800 million
                                lines of code, as well as bioinformatics and machine learning workflows. We show that,
                                while software in each of these domains is initially irreproducible, DetTrace brings
                                reproducibility without requiring any hardware, OS, or application changes. My largest
                                contribution to the system was extending the container's sequential scheduler to run in
                                parallel in system-call-free regions of code while still maintaining a deterministic
                                scheduling, bringing the overhead down to just 2% for
                                some of our compute-bound benchmarks. The open-source code can be found <a
                                    target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dettrace/dettrace"><b>here</b></a>, and our

                                I worked somewhat outside my normal realm, but still with the Rust programming language,

                                My largest contribution was adapting the distributed API to allow for incremental,
                                on-the-fly reconfiguration of the nodes within the network, improving fault-tolerance.
